= gotee

like unix `tee` but for slack

== example

=== simple

Pipe `STDOUT` to slack

[source,bash]
----
echo "test" | gotee
----

Stream `STDOUT` to slack, appends new lines to message every 5 seconds

[source,bash]
----
while true; do echo test; sleep 1; done | gotee
----

=== systemd failure notifications

==== Create a gotee systemd unit file

[source,bash]
----
systemctl edit --full --force gotee@.service
----

==== Content of the gotee unit file

[source,ini]
----
[Unit]
Description=Send slack notification

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/systemctl status %i | /usr/local/bin/gotee'
----

==== Finally, add gotee as OnFailure unit

[source,ini]
----
[Unit]
...
OnFailure=gotee@%n
----

===== Notifications for all units

You can place a top-level (global) `OnFailure` in `/etc/systemd/system/service.d/10-notify-failed.conf`

== configuration

either use the environment variables `GOTEE_SLACK_TOKEN` and `GOTEE_SLACK_CHANNEL`
or place a config file in `/etc/gotee/config.yml`
